\chapter*{About This Book} 
\section*{Note on the Text}
The version you are reading is little more than a scrapbook still many revisions away from a
finished product. If you find the writing hard going or the attempts to explain things difficult
to follow, by all means \href{https://github.com/mwenge/iatheory/issues}{\textcolor{blue}{leave me a note}} and
I will gratefully accept your complaint. In the meantime, please skip over any blemishes
to the next pretty picture or promising-looking block of text.

The full source code is available in \href{https://github.com/mwenge/iridisalpha}{\textcolor{blue}{its own Github repository}}. 
You should find that it matches exactly the snippets of code provided in the book, though in some cases the extracts in the book have been edited
and reformatted for brevity.

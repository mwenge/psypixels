The listing is so short that it possible (and hopefully not too tedious) for us to
review it in its entirety. This will allow us to understand the basic workings of 
a small 'game' such as this one, from booting to running; it will also give us an
accurate idea of how the final 'Psychedelia' product worked. The difference between
the released game and the listing that appeared in Popular Computing Weekly is not
qualitative - the underlying structure is the same, the core routines we reviewed 
in the previous chapter are more or less identical. The differences lie only in the
the wealth of options available, so it turns out that the listing is an ideal way
for us to get our heads around the core mechanics of the light synthesizer. In the
chapters that follow we can look at some of the features added to the game in more
detail and concentrate on the individual routines that made them work. Here we will
focus instead on the high-level operation of the game and hopefully obtain a sense
of how the thing hangs together.

For the most part I try to present the code in the order it appears in the game
binary itself, but I have moved some routines around here and there so that we're
reading the code in an order that makes sense to the reader.
